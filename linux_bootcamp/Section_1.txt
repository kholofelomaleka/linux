1. Linux Distributions
-- Linux = OS, therefore Linux distribution is a collection of software and application bundled together.
-- Distributions / Distro / Flavour ==> have curated software that work well together.

-- **Linux Kernal** (All Distributions have a kernal) - This is the intermediary between the software/applications and hardware.  The kernal is the heart/core of the linux distro
